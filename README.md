# Condition Monitoring of Railway Tracks with Soft and Stretchable Sensors
Ngee Ann Polytechnic Engineering Science Final Year Project, done in collaboration with NUS and SBS Transit with my partner Yeoh Guan Wei in 2018.

This project was split into 2, 6-months long periods where the end goal was to develop a system that can automated the detection of wear and tear on the railway tracks along Singapore's LRT line.

In this repository is our final report for this project.

From this project, I was introduced and did research on **RFID technology**.
I was also able to pick up **Raspberry Pi programming using Java**.
And finally, I was able to apply physics theory such as Newton's laws of motion in a real-life application.
